            connection with the Terms of Use or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
            of Singapore to which you hereby agree to submit. <br>

            In the event that the law in an Alternate Country does not allow jurisdiction to be that of the courts of
            Singapore or where judgment of a Singapore court is unenforceable in the Alternate Country, unresolved
            disputes shall be referred to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), in accordance with
            the Rules of the SIAC as modified or amended from time to time (the “Rules”) by a sole arbitrator appointed

            agree on an arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall be appointed by the President of SIAC in accordance with the
            Rules. <br>

            The seat and venue of the arbitration shall be Singapore, in the English language and the fees of the
            Arbitrator shall be borne equally by you and the Company, provided that the Arbitrator may require that such

            clause to be enforceable under applicable law. <br>

            No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, the Company or any
            third party provider as a result of the Terms of Use or use of the Service. <br>

            and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law. This shall, without
            limitation, also apply to the applicable law and jurisdiction as stipulated above.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The failure of the Company to enforce any right or provision in the Terms of Use shall not
            constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by the Company in writing.
            The Terms of Use comprises the entire agreement between you and the Company and supersedes all prior or
            contemporaneous negotiations or discussions, whether written or oral (if any) between the parties regarding
            the subject matter contained herein.

            You hereby agree that the Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement immediately in the event that you
            are found to be in breach of any of the terms stipulated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
            termination of this Agreement shall not require the Company to compensate, reimburse or cover any cost
            incurred by you in the course of you acquiring services from the third party transportation provider under
            this Agreement.</p>
