        <p class="paragraph">This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how RushOwl Singapore Pte Ltd
            (otherwise, known as RushOwl) will use your Personal Data.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Collection of Personal Data
            <br>
            “Personal Data” means information about you, from which you are identifiable, including but not limited to
            your name, nationality, address, telephone number, fax number, bank details, credit card details, gender,
            resident status, financial background, personal interests, email address, your occupation, your photo, any

            installed on your device) and your vehicle registration data
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The provision of your Personal Data is voluntary. However, if you do not provide RushOwl your Personal Data,
            RushOwl will not be able to process your Personal Data for the Purposes and Additional Purposes outlined
            below and may cause RushOwl to be unable to provide services or products to or accept payments from you.

            If you are an agent, vendor, supplier or service provider, provision of your Personal Data is mandatory and

            services provided.
            <br>
            In addition to the Personal Data you provide to RushOwl directly, RushOwl may collect your Personal Data
            from publicly available sources or from third parties, for example:
